SchedUI
========

SchedUI is a Web frontend for scheduling at radio observatories.
It uses SchedulingEngine for problem formulation and scheduling algorithms.

=== Setting up Rails ===
  * install jruby
   
  * put jruby's bin directory in the PATH: e.g.
     $ export PATH=/home/user/Downloads/jruby-1.6.0.RC1/bin:$PATH
     If you put this into ~/.bashrc, it will automatically be set for each new shell.
  * installing some needed packages:
     $ gem install activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter activerecord-jdbc-adapter activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter jdbc-mysql jdbc-sqlite3 jruby-openssl
 
=== Setting up the project ===
  * you need to create an empty database rails can access (we use mysql at the moment). In config/database.yml, change the hostname/username/password/databasename
  $ rake db:migrate
     creates the tables
  $ rake db:seed
     fills the tables with sample data
     * JRuby will also have to be able to access the SchedEng jar, and 
       the mysql-connector-java jar.
       For this, the environment variable CLASSPATH has to point to them
        $ JRUBYDIR=$(dirname $(which jruby))/..
        $ JAR=$(find "$JRUBYDIR" -name 'mysql-connector-java*.jar')
        $ CLASSPATH="$JAR:/home/user/workspace/arrayscheduling/SchedEng/target/engine-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:$CLASSPATH"
        $ export CLASSPATH
        If you put this into ~/.bashrc, it will automatically be set for each new shell.

=== Running ===
  $ rails server
     runs the rails server. You can now access it under http://localhost:3000/
To run the scheduling process, go to http://localhost:3000/process
This will launch app/controllers/process_controller.rb, which gets all the jobs from the database, and calls SchedEng.
