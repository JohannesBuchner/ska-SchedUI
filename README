SchedUI
========

SchedUI is a Web frontend for scheduling at radio observatories.
It uses SchedulingEngine for problem formulation and scheduling algorithms.

=== Setting up ===
  * install jruby
    
  * put jruby's bin directory in the PATH: e.g.
     $ export PATH=/home/user/Downloads/jruby-1.6.0.RC1/bin:$PATH

  * you need to create an empty database rails can access (we use mysql at the moment). In config/database.yml, change the hostname/username/password/databasename
  $ rake db:migrate
     creates the tables
  $ rake db:seed
     fills the tables with sample data
     * Ruby will also have to be able to access the SchedEng jar. 
       For this, the environment variable CLASSPATH has to point to it 
       and the JGAP jar:
        $ JRUBYDIR=$(dirname $(which jruby))/..
        $ JAR=$(find "$JRUBYDIR" -name 'mysql-connector-java*.jar')
        $ CLASSPATH="$JAR:/home/user/workspace/arrayscheduling/SchedEng/target/engine-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:~/.m2/repository/net/sf/jgap/jgap/3.4.4/jgap-3.4.4.jar:$CLASSPATH"
        $ export CLASSPATH

=== Running ===
  $ rails server
     runs the rails server. You can now access it under http://localhost:3000/
To run the scheduling process, go to http://localhost:3000/process
This will launch app/controllers/process_controller.rb, which gets all the jobs from the database, and calls SchedEng.
